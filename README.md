# CodeAlpha Disease Prediction

ðŸ©º As part of my CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship, I developed a model to predict the likelihood of diseases based on patient data using classification algorithms.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights:
- Predicted disease risk from medical data
- Used models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset:
The medical dataset `heart.csv` is included in this repository.  
It contains patient health records with features like age, symptoms, test results, etc.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
